# Tubely - Video Storage Platform with Go + AWS S3 + SQLite

Tubely is a simple but powerful video storage and streaming platform built using **Go**, **AWS S3**, and **SQLite**. It supports video upload, metadata storage, thumbnail generation, and playback ‚Äì all wrapped in a clean and modern stack.

> üí° Originally inspired by the Boot.dev course ["Learn File Servers and CDNs with S3 and CloudFront"](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-file-servers-s3-cloudfront-golang), this project has been fully adapted, expanded, and maintained by **Leon Thomas**.

---

## Features

- üì¶ Upload and store videos with thumbnails
- üßæ SQLite-based video metadata and user management
- üåê Simple front-end using native HTML5 `<video>` tag
- üîê JWT-based user authentication (WIP)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud file storage with AWS S3
- üéûÔ∏è Video processing with `ffmpeg` (aspect ratio, thumbnails)
- üõ†Ô∏è Built with Go and the AWS SDK (v2)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Basic HTML/CSS + JS
- **Backend:** Go
  - Standard Libraries: `net/http`, `os`, `log`, `crypto`, `context`
  - Third-Party: `aws-sdk-go-v2`, `godotenv`
- **Storage:**
  - Local: SQLite3 (for metadata, users, auth)
  - Cloud: AWS S3 Bucket (video + thumbnail storage)
- **Tools:**
  - `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe` for video parsing & thumbnail generation
  - `sqlc` for type-safe database queries

## Quickstart

> ‚ö†Ô∏è While this README gives you a fast overview, **follow the course or setup guide** for in-depth instructions.

### 1. Install dependencies

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Run:  
  ```bash
  go mod download
  ```

- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
  ```bash
  # Linux
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install sqlite3

  # macOS
  brew update && brew install sqlite3
  ```

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

---

### 2. Download Sample Videos

```bash
./samplesdownload.sh
```

Creates a `/samples` folder containing demo videos and images.

---

### 3. Configure Environment

Copy and configure the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your AWS credentials, S3 bucket name, etc. Follow prompts in the app or course instructions.

---

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
go run .
```

This will:

- Create a `tubely.db` file (SQLite database)
- Create an `assets/` folder for storing thumbnails
- Start a local server with a link to access the site

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Video upload to S3
- [x] Metadata storage in SQLite
- [x] Basic UI with video player
- [ ] JWT user auth system
- [ ] User dashboard to manage uploads
- [ ] S3 file expiration / cleanup
